Weathering steel forms a protective layer of rust, known as patina, which adheres to the steel surface and protects the weathering steel surface from further corrosion. Based on these samples, a quantitative patina rating index (QPRI) was developed to evaluate the patina performance and quantitatively assign a patina rating based on particle size analysis performed on the tape adhesion samples. The repository consists of .pdf and .png files of the tape adhesion representative test samples collected during the field evaluations performed on Texas weathering steel bridge steel girders and their corresponding masked and thresholded image generated during particle size analysis.
